# make a dataset

### cols:

all words,
yellow words, green words, blue words, purple words,
yellow hint, green hint, blue hint purple hint,

### rows: each day

train some sort of bot on it? using word2vec? using bigrams or other ngrams? somehow parsing through related words and the neighboring word's neighboring words to find connections?
